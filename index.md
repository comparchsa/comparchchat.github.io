# What is the ArchChat Social Hour?

The ArchChat Social Hour is a fully-virtual monthly social event organized jointly by [CASA](http://www.comparchsa.org) and [PLTea](http://pltea.github.io). 
PLTea is a similar initiative within the PL (programming languages) community and has graciously offered to help establish our own series within computer architecture.

We plan to meet monthly, virtually via Zoom where attendees will randomly break into small social rooms (3-4 people apiece) so we can chat about 
school, work, or whatever comes to mind. 


# Who can join in?

While the ArchChat Social Hour is geared towards students in computer architecture, all are welcome to join!
Those in adjacent research areas to computer architecture are also welcome.

Note that ArchChat Social Hour is inherently informal and is a chance to chat with fellow computer architecture 
researchers, do know it is still a professional event and everyone is expected to abide with [CARES][cares] policies.

# How do I join?

Each ArchChat Social Hour instantiation will have its own Zoom Registration Link. Register via the link(s) below. If you are signed up to the 
CASA mailing list and/or participate in our Slack workspace, we will also share up-to-date information there. If you are not, 
be sure to [sign up][signup] to stay in touch. Chat with you soon!
